## Clone Instructions

1. Clone
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**"git clone git://github.com/gauravk92/Pandorium.git"**<br />
2. Init/Update Submodules
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**"git submodule init;git submodule update"**<br />

## Build Instructions

I use Xcode 4 but based on Apple's statements about Xcode 4, it should open/build just fine in Xcode 3. The only problem I see is I normally build with LLVM 2.0, Xcode 3 has up to LLVM 1.5, don't know the specific changes but may build differently. Shouldn't be any build errors, some IB one's but who cares ;). Choose Debug/Release - Go.
